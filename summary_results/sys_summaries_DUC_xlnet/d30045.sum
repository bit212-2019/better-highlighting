Whether or not the talks between Exxon and Mobil lead to a merger
the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either
Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would create the world's largest oil company
a person close to the discussions said the boards of both Exxon and Mobil
that there would be huge cuts in duplicate staff from both companies
the transaction would probably be an exchange of Mobil shares for Exxon shares
this has been a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry
profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices
because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly toward either the Clinton administration 's or the European Union's positions on global warming
