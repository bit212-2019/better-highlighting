Pet owners were worried Saturday that the pet food in their cupboard may be deadly after millions of containers of dog and cat food sold at major retailers across North America were recalled.
More than 60 million cans of dog and cat food sold under dozens of brand names were recalled on Saturday after being linked to the deaths of 10 animals.
A Canadian pet-food supplier recalled some of its dog and cat food Sunday after several pets in the United States died, local media reported.
Menu Foods, the Ontario-based company that produced the pet food, said Saturday it was recalling dog food sold under 48 brands and cat food sold under 40 brands including Iams, Nutro and Eukanuba.
An unknown number of cats and dogs had suffered kidney failure and about 10 died after eating the affected pet food, the company said.
