Indonesia has widened the search for hundreds of people missing after a ferry sank, as survivors were found hundreds of kilometres from where the ship went down, a navy officer said Thursday.
Indonesia Friday expanded the search for survivors of a ferry which sank a week ago to waters off the resort island of Bali, hundreds of kilometres from where the ship went down, officials said.
World War II sea mines and shipwrecks are hampering the search for a ferry which sank north of the central Indonesian island of Java, a navy officer said Thursday.
Fourteen people on board a ferry that sank in Indonesia were picked up by a passing cargo ship after spending nine days on a life raft, a rescue official said Monday.
