A top Army general vowed Wednesday to personally oversee the upgrading of Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Building 18, a dilapidated former hotel that houses wounded soldiers as outpatients.
The Army's surgeon general on Thursday criticized stories in The Washington Post disclosing problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, saying the series unfairly characterized the living conditions and care for soldiers recuperating from wounds at the hospital's facilities.
To the Army's public affairs chief, it was simply an effort to ``get the facts out from our perspective.''
Defense Secretary Robert Gates named an independent review panel Friday to investigate what he called an ``unacceptable situation'' in outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and he said that some soldiers ``most directly involved'' in the problems have been removed from their positions.
