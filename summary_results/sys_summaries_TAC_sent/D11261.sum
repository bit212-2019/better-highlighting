Iraqi reporter throws shoe at Bush in Baghdad BAGHDAD, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at visiting U.S. President George W. Bush and called him a "dog" in Arabic during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad on Sunday.
The incident occurred as Bush was appearing Sunday with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
Bush ducked and wasn't hit by either shoe.
"All I can report," Bush joked of the incident, "is a size 10."
Iraqi reporters started shouting what Bush later explained were apologies for the incident.
