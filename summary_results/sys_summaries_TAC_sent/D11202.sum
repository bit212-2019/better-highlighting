Changes in climate and strong demand for water could drain Lake Mead, the man-made reservoir in Nevada and Arizona that helps manage water for seven western U.S. states, triggering severe shortages across the region, scientists warn.
Las Vegas -- No Fishing From Harbor, a roadside sign at Lake Mead warns, but the harbor is long gone.
Lake Mead, the vast reservoir for the Colorado River water that sustains the fast-growing cities of Phoenix and Las Vegas, could lose water faster than previously thought and run dry within 13 years, according to a new study by scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
There is a 50 percent chance Lake Mead, a key source of water for millions of people in the southwestern United States, will be dry by 2021 if climate changes and future water usage are not curtailed, U.S. scientists warned on Monday.
