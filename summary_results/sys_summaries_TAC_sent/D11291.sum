Raising vitamin D levels by taking supplements and absorbing a little bit of sunshine each day may help prevent colorectal and breast cancers, said two studies published Tuesday.
COLORECTAL CANCER More vitamin D might mean less risk.
Two new vitamin D studies have revealed new prescriptions for possibly preventing up to half of the cases of breast cancer and two-thirds of the cases of colorectal cancer in the United States.
Canada's Cancer Society on Thursday urged people to increase vitamin D intake, citing growing evidence of the supplement reducing cancer risks.
Adequate intake of vitamin D may help prevent cancer, according to a new study.
Might higher levels of vitamin D in the blood lower the likelihood of developing this cancer?
