Prosecutors had argued that Juan Manuel Alvarez, 29, intended to kill commuters as part of a sick attempt to gain attention from his estranged wife when he parked his vehicle on the Metrolink train tracks.
After convicting Juan Alvarez of first-degree murder and recommending a life sentence without parole, some jurors in the Metrolink train derailment case last month said they really didn't think Alvarez intended to kill anyone.
"If there were a sentence known as 'forever' in state prison," Pounders told Alvarez, "I would give it to you.
Three of the jurors said they likely wouldn't even have convicted Alvarez on the 11 counts of first-degree murder if it hadn't been for that law.
