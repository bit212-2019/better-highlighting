A man found guilty of murder for causing a Los Angeles train crash that left 11 people dead should be jailed for life without parole, a jury recommended on Tuesday.
A murder defendant apologized Tuesday for causing a commuter train disaster that killed 11 people, testifying that he was trying to kill himself and never meant to harm anyone else.
LOS ANGELES - The man who caused the 2005 Metrolink train derailment that left 11 dead was "violent" and "dangerous" and considered killing people in the days leading up to the crash, he said Wednesday during cross-examination in his murder trial.
Defense attorneys had argued that Alvarez was only trying to kill himself when he drove his gasoline-soaked Jeep on train tracks in suburban Glendale.
