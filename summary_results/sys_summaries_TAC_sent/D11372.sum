Seven people were killed over the weekend when a construction crane collapsed in New York, police said Monday, reporting the discovery of three more bodies in the rubble.
Rescuers dug through debris for three people still missing in the rubble and wreckage left when a construction crane toppled like a tree across a city block and killed at least four construction workers.
The last of seven bodies was pulled from the rubble Monday at the site of a crane collapse that obliterated a town house in New York City and severely damaged other buildings.
Since Saturday's collapse of a towering construction crane on the East Side of Manhattan, attention has understandably focused on the central and spectacular details, on the lives lost, the 22-story crane that toppled, the building that was demolished.
