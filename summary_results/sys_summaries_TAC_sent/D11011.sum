A gunman shot girls in the head  "execution style" at an Amish school in Pennsylvania state on  Monday, killing four and wounding at least six others, police and  officials said.
Six people were dead after a gunman opened fire in a one-room Amish schoolhouse Monday in Pennsylvania's bucolic Lancaster County, the county coroner said.
An armed man walked into an Amish school, sent the boys outside and tied up and shot the girls, killing three of them, authorities said.
Two relatives of the man who attacked Amish school girls said Monday they were not molested by him 20 years ago, as he had claimed in a phone call to his wife during the siege.
Charles Carl Roberts IV may have planned to molest the girls at the Amish school, but police have no evidence that he actually did, State Police Commissioner Jeffrey B. Miller said.
