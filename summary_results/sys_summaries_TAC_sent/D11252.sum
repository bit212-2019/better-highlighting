Polar bears face extinction due to persistent inaction by the international community in the face of climate change, conservation group WWF warned on Monday.
More than 500,000 people have commented on a proposal to list polar bears as "threatened" under the U.S.
The shores of Siberia's Chukchi Peninsula have been littered with the carcasses of young walruses.
Two-thirds of the world's polar bears will disappear by 2050, even under moderate projections for shrinking summer sea ice caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, government scientists reported Friday.
The finding is part of a year-long review of the effects of climate and ice changes on polar bears to help determine whether they should be protected under the Endangered Species Act.
