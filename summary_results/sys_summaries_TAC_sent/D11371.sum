Three people were still listed as missing Sunday as rescue teams picked through the rubble of a town house crushed by a toppling construction crane in an accident that killed four construction workers.
Four construction workers were killed Saturday afternoon when a towering crane toppled onto a Manhattan apartment building, in what Mayor Michael Bloomberg called one of the city's worst construction accidents ever.
A crane tower at an East Side construction site toppled out of a blue sky without warning Saturday, killing four construction workers and injuring eight others, three of them critically, authorities said.
