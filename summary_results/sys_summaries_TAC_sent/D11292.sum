Women deficient in vitamin D at the time of a breast cancer diagnosis are more likely to die or see the tumor spread, a Canadian study published in the United States has shown.
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to 26 percent greater risk of death in men and women, according to a study published Monday that appears to confirm the importance of this essential nutrient.
A large new study in the U.S. found no sign that vitamin D lowers the overall risk of dying from cancer, injecting a note of caution to the latest vitamin craze.
Once thought of as helping only to develop strong bones, vitamin D is now believed to serve many purposes in the human body.
The team also found that only 24 percent of the women had what are normally considered adequate levels of vitamin D at the time of the diagnosis.
