At least three people were killed in the the collapse of a bridge Wednesday in Minneapolis, Minnesota that sent cars and trucks tumbling into the Mississippi River, officials said.
Authorities lowered the death toll from an interstate bridge collapse to four Thursday, but warned the final number could change as divers search the Mississippi River.
Divers searched the Mississippi River on Thursday for more bodies entombed in cars trapped beneath the twisted steel and concrete slabs of a collapsed bridge.
A school bus was on the bridge but did not fall into the river as it collapsed, local media reports.
"We have a number of vehicles that are underneath big pieces of concrete, and we do know we have some people in those vehicles," Dolan said Thursday morning.
