Two international fishing industry groups called for limits to tuna catches Wednesday to stop the population of the fish from deteriorating due to overfishing.
An international meeting aimed at saving global tuna populations from overfishing is set Friday to adopt a first-of-a-kind global action plan.
Fisheries officials from around the world began discussing ways to reverse a sharp decline in tuna catches as a five-day conference kicked off Monday in Japan.
About 300 representatives from five international conservation bodies and more than 60 countries and regions gathered in the Japanese port city of Kobe on Monday for a five-day meeting to talk about optimal and sustainable ways to strengthen the conservation of tuna as the stocks are rapidly declining due to overfishing.
Japan is the world's biggest tuna consumer, eating one quarter of the global catch.
