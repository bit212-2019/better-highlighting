The murky, swirling waters of the Mississippi river hampered the work of divers Thursday searching for up to 30 people still missing one day after a huge bridge collapsed, killing at least four.
Minnesota officials were warned as early as 1990 that the bridge that collapsed into the Mississippi River was "structurally deficient," yet they relied on a strategy of patchwork fixes and stepped-up inspections.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted Friday to direct $250 million (nearly euro183 million) to rebuild the Minnesota bridge that was destroyed in this week's deadly collapse.
Divers looking in the Mississippi River for victims of a bridge collapse were forced to suspend their search Saturday, hampered by debris shifting in the swirling, murky current.
