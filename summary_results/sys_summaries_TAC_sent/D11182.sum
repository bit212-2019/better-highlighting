The gunman who killed eight people in a mall shooting "just snapped," he said in a hand-scrawled suicide note released Friday that combines love for his friends and family with nothing but contempt for his random victims.
Chilling surveillance images of the gunman who killed eight people in an Omaha department store show a shaggy-haired, bespectacled Robert Hawkins taking aim at holiday shoppers.
Police released three still images Friday, two days after Robert A. Hawkins killed eight people and himself at Westroads Mall's Von Maur store.
Hawkins left the note at the Bellevue house where he lived before going to Omaha's Westroads Mall on Wednesday with an AK-47.
