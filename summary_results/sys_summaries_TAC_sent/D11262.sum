Saddam Hussein's former lawyer said on Monday that he was forming a team to defend the Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at US President George W. Bush during his farewell visit to Baghdad.
An Iraqi government official says a reporter who threw his shoes at U.S. President George W. Bush is being held for questioning by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's guards and is being tested for alcohol and drugs.
A day after a little-known Iraqi television journalist threw his shoes at President Bush at a news conference in Baghdad on Sunday, his act of defiance toward the American commander-in-chief continued to resonate throughout Iraq and beyond.
Calling someone the "son of a shoe" is one of the worst insults in Iraq.
