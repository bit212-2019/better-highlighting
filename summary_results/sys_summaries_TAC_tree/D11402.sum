Flood relief workers in Bangladesh struggled Friday to reach millions of people stranded in their villages without food or clean water
Monsoon floods ravaging Bangladesh for more than a week have killed about 46 people and displaced or marooned millions
jumped Thursday to 54 people dead, with more than five million others displaced, after monsoon rains and Himalayan snowmelt caused rivers to overflow
Helicopters dropped food to almost two million hungry and frightened villagers perched on rooftops in India on Saturday, as the death toll from monsoon rains in India and neighboring
current monsoon floods that brought havoc to crops and infrastructure in Bangladesh
has risen to 81 while the flood control and relief officials feared further deterioration of the situation in central region of Bangladesh
