Women deficient in vitamin D at the time of a breast cancer diagnosis are more likely to die or see the tumor spread
A flurry of recent research indicating that Vitamin D may have a dizzying array of health benefits
may outweigh the associated skin cancer risks for people who are deficient in Vitamin D, especially those who live in colder northern latitudes, according to a study released Monday
found no sign that vitamin D lowers the overall risk of dying from cancer, injecting a note of caution to the latest vitamin craze
that only 24 percent of the women had what are normally considered adequate levels of vitamin D at the time of the diagnosis
have insufficient levels of vitamin D and are thus at a higher risk of debilitating diseases such as osteoporosis, cancer and diabetes, according to a Canadian study released Wednesday
