Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who was to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an and a possibility of congressional leadership challenges _ came as election results showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45 hold over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in the House.
A struggle for control of the House is under way, with Rep. Robert Livingston conducting a telephone campaign that could lead to him running against Newt Gingrich as speaker.
Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the same way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six to deadlock the vote. Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections, when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House.
