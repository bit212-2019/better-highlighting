A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180 in Sweden's second-largest city.
The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening.
The earlier information that police gave out was wrong, Hand Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, told a news conference.
The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas.
On Friday, police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene, and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials said.
Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire.
