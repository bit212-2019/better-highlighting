Police detained and questioned the organizer of a group set up by dissidents to monitor official corruption and told him the group's activities must cease, a human rights group said Thursday.
A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has been in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of inciting the overthrow of the government, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu, as well as several other activists involved with him in trying to form the China Democratic Party, set off strong protests from human rights groups, other Chinese dissidents and Washington.
