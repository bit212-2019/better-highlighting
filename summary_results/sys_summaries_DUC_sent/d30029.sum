A major search was under way in Bass Strait off Australia's southeast coast on Sunday night for an injured crewman swept overboard during the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race.
Two yacht crew members are dead, three yachts remain missing and rescue resources were stretched to the limit Monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continued to batter the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet.
Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving three yachts missing.
Two crew found dead on the stricken 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad were left behind while seven colleagues were winched aboard the helicopter and flown to Merimbula Hospital, he said.
Despite the conditions, Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was unlikely the race would be called off.
