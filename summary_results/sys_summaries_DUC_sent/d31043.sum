Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to win a fourth term in office have hit a snag after he failed to receive the expected speedy appointment from new President Emile Lahoud.
Lahoud is to be sworn in for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri as prime minister.
Lahoud is virtually assured of the job: the prime minister and the parliament speaker first approved Lahoud, who then won the all-important backing of Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
A presidential decree was expected Friday but nothing came through after a meeting between Lahoud and Hariri.
