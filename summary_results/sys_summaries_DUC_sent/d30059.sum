A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said.
In modern Russia, the crime was so common as to be mundane.
Mourners bearing flowers and candles gathered Sunday outside the house on Griboyedova Canal where a Russian legislator, Galina Staravoitova, was shot to death on Friday night.
Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment building along with her aide, Ruslan Linkov, the Interfax news agency reported.
Galina Starovoitova was one, and her murder in St. Petersburg on Friday was a terrible loss for Russia.
There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg in recent months.
