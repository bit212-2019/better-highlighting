What started as a local controversy in Salt Lake City has evolved into a full-blown international scandal.
Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Sunday he might be thrown out of the International Olympic Committee for making allegations of corruption within the Olympic movement.
Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractices in the voting for the 1996 Atlanta Games, 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2002 Salt Lake Games.
Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment.
Hodler, who made the allegations Saturday, said he has since been muzzled by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
