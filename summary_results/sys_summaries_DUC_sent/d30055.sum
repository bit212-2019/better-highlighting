By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he went to the presidential palace to resign.
Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling in political leaders Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new government.
Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which is key to Italy's participation in the European common currency.
Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the Communists' support.
