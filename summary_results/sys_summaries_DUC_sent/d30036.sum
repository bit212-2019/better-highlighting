Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, whose capricious vision includes a section of Europe breaking off and floating out to sea, on Thursday was named the winner of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize.
Jose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday.
Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United States on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize.
Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States, was awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm.
It has taken all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the Portuguese language, Saramago said at the Frankfurt Book Fair, speaking through an interpreter.
