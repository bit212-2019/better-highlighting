Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy about who will be his successor.
The arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead to massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's trade minister said Thursday.
Jailed, beaten and facing trial on 10 sexual misconduct and corruption charges, ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is a political underdog in Malaysia.
On Sept. 2, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, calling him morally unfit for office.
Mahathir and Anwar had differed over economic policy and Anwar says Mahathir feared him as an alternative leader.
Anwar was sacked on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, after he had differed with Mahathir on policy for escaping economic recession.
